## Company Landing Page: opening hours and days

The code contains a page which contains a section that displays a "We are Open" or "We are closed" message, depending
on the opening hours ( 08:00 ~ 20:00 ). You must do the following:

- 1) Move all the JavaScript code found in the page, in a single `script` tag placed before the closing `body` tag.
- 2) Replace all `document.write()` methods, and use either `innerText` or `innerHTML` to place the dynamic content
- 3) Add a check for opening days as well (Monday ~ Friday). Our store is closed at the weekends.
- 4) Add a check for holidays and make sure the "We are closed" is being displayed on the following dates:
    - 01/01, 25/03, 01/05, 28/20
